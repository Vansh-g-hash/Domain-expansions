# Gojo Satoru – Domain Expansion (Interactive Visual Project)

An interactive browser-based visual experience inspired by Gojo Satoru’s
Domain Expansion from Jujutsu Kaisen.

The project uses real-time hand tracking and 3D particle effects to trigger
different visual techniques directly using hand gestures.

Built and refactored by Vansh Gupta.
